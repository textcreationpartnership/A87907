            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To His EXCELLENCY, GENERAL MONCK. A Letter from the Gentlemen of Devon: in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his Lordſhips of <hi>January</hi> 23. to them directed from <hi>Leiceſter.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THere is a Letter which hath paſſed the Preſs under your Name, dated at <hi>Leiceſter 23. Jan.</hi> and directed <hi>unto Mr.</hi> Rolle, <hi>to be communicated to the reſt of the Gentry of</hi> Devon: &amp;c.—Whether this be your Excellencies Act or not, is the queſtion. If ſo it be, we receive it as a noble Reſpect from <hi>General Monk</hi> to his <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Country-men;</hi> if otherwiſe; we look upon it as the <hi>Artifice</hi> of an <hi>Anti-Parliamentary Faction,</hi> under the <hi>pretence</hi> of your <hi>Concurrence</hi> and <hi>Aid,</hi> to <hi>delude</hi> and <hi>enſlave</hi> the Nation.</p>
            <p>'It is <hi>one</hi> thing for a Perſon of Honour freely to communicate his Thoughts and Reaſonings, (although in favour of a poſſible miſtake) ſtill referring the Iſſue to the determinations of <hi>Divinity,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon:</hi> and it is <hi>another</hi> thing, for a <hi>Confederate Party</hi> to charge <hi>ſuch</hi> a Perſon with failings properly their <hi>own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To haſten the diſpatch of that little we have to ſay, the Authours of this are of that number to whom your Letter directs. We ſhall proceed according to our Duties, and Inſtructions, and briefly acquaint your Excellency with the ſenſe of thoſe that have entruſted us.</p>
            <p>We ſhall begin (my Lord) with the <hi>Conceſſion</hi> of what we much <hi>ſuſpect;</hi> and take for <hi>granted,</hi> that the Letter ſo inſcribed, is really <hi>Yours.</hi> We are next, to return you the <hi>thanks</hi> of your <hi>Country-men,</hi> for the expreſſions of your <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Care,</hi> therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and <hi>particularly, that in the head of your Army, you have rather choſen Arguments of Reaſon, then of Force.—That you propoſe the word of God, for your Rule; and the Settlement of the Nation, for your end.—That you take notice of many Factions, and Intereſts intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and yet profeſs a ſervicc to none of them.—That you ſo earneſtly deſire to compoſe old Differences at home, and to prevent new miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs from abroad.—And finally; That you ſubmit the Reſult of all, to a fair, and rational examination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>profeſs,</hi> and to <hi>perſue</hi> all this, is but <hi>like your ſelf;</hi> and <hi>to theſe purpoſes,</hi> we ſhall not ſtick to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>dye</hi> at your <hi>Feet.</hi> If upon Diſcuſſion of the Reaſons you alledge, we aſſume the Liberty which your Candour allows us, of declaring wherein we differ; we beg to be underſtood with all tenderneſs toward your Excellency; to whom, as a ſtranger to our late Oppreſſions and Calamities, the ſtate of our Affairs, and Affections, may probably be miſrepreſented. To obſerve your own Method; our Letter to the <hi>Speaker, importing the recalling of the Secluded Members</hi> was the <hi>occaſion</hi> of <hi>yours</hi> to <hi>Us;</hi> which ſayes, that; <q>
                  <hi>Before theſe Wars, our Government was Monarchical, both in Church, and State; but</hi> (as the caſe ſtands now) <hi>Monarchy cannot poſsibly be admitted for the future, in theſe Nations; becauſe it is incompatible with the ſeveral Intereſts which have enſued upon the Quarrel:</hi> viz. <hi>the Presbyterian, Independent, Anabaptiſts, &amp;c. (as to Eccleſiaſticks) and the Purchaſers of Crown, and Biſhops Lands, Forfeited Eſtates, &amp;c. (as to Civils) by which means, the ſupport it ſelf is taken away; ſo that the Conſtitution, qualified to fix all Intereſts, muſt be that of a Republique: To which, the Secluded Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of 1648. will never agree, many of them being Aſſertours of Monarchy, and Diſclaimers to all Laws made ſince their Secluſion: over and above, that the Army alſo will never endure it. The Concluſion this; that it were better for us to deſiſt from that Paper, and rely upon the Promiſes of this Parliament, for a due Repreſentative:—a Proviſion for ſucceeding Parliaments, and a Peaceable Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, then by an unſeaſonable Impatience to embroil the Nation in a freſh Engagement.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>From hence it appears, that we might be allowed a Free Parliament, but for four Reaſons. Firſt, <hi>The Major Part Inclines to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy and they that have ſwallowed the Revenues of the Crown, declare againſt it.</hi> Secondly, <hi>The Entangled Intereſts of this Nation can never be United, but under a Republique.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>The Army will never endure it.</hi> And laſtly, <hi>It would beget a new War,</hi> whereas <hi>this Parliament promiſis to ſettle us in a laſting Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To all which, in Order, and <hi>firſt,</hi> concerning <hi>Monarchy,</hi> (not as the thing which we contend for) we (onely) wonder why it is <hi>prejudged,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, by <hi>thoſe</hi> Perſons who have <hi>ſworn</hi> to <hi>defend</hi> it. But, my Lord, you have hit the Reaſon; they have <hi>gained</hi> by <hi>Diſſolving</hi> it, and they are afraid to <hi>loſe</hi> by <hi>Reſtoring</hi> it. Having put the <hi>Father</hi> to <hi>Death,</hi> whom they <hi>Covenanted</hi> to <hi>Preſerve;</hi> they <hi>Abjure</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> whom they fear to <hi>Truſt.</hi> By <hi>Force</hi> they would <hi>maintain,</hi> what by <hi>Force</hi> they have <hi>Gotten.</hi> In effect; the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> is not ſo much, what <hi>Government,</hi> as what <hi>Governours:</hi> A <hi>Single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> will down well enough, with the fierceſt of them, <hi>when it lies fair for any of themſelves.</hi> Witneſs the <hi>late Protectour,</hi> and the <hi>later Lambert.</hi> Briefly, ſince the <hi>Death</hi> of the <hi>late King,</hi> we have been <hi>Govern'd</hi> by <hi>Tumult; Bandy'd</hi> from <hi>One Faction</hi> to the <hi>Other: This</hi> Party up <hi>to day, That to Morrow;</hi> but ſtill the <hi>Nation under,</hi> and a <hi>Prey</hi> to the <hi>Strongeſt.</hi> It is a feeble Argument <hi>againſt Monarchy,</hi> that we never have been happy ſince we <hi>loſt</hi> it: and yet nothing hath appeared to obſtruct our Quiet, but the <hi>Diviſion</hi> of the <hi>Booty.</hi> What <hi>Hath</hi> been, <hi>Shall</hi> be, ſo long as this <hi>Violence</hi> continues over us: nor can any other Government <hi>Settle</hi> the Nation, then that which <hi>pleaſes</hi> the Univerſality of it. And in that, we pretend not to <hi>direct</hi> our Repreſentatives: but which way ſoever they encline, we ſhall with our <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Fortunes</hi> Juſtifie, and <hi>Obey</hi> their <hi>Appointments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether we <hi>have</hi> Reaſon, or <hi>not, in this Particular,</hi> let your Excellency Judge.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> Objection againſt a <hi>Free Parliament,</hi> is drawn from the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of a <hi>Republique, to reconcile all Intereſts.</hi> To this, we offer, <hi>firſt,</hi> that is not <hi>neceſſary;</hi> next, that it is not ſo much as <hi>effectual,</hi> to that purpoſe; and <hi>laſtly,</hi> that a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> ought to <hi>Introduce</hi> it, if it were both the <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> we prove, thus, <hi>It is not the Form of Government, but the conſent of the People, that muſt Settle the Nation. The Publique Debt, muſt be ſecured out of the Publique Stock; and that diſpoſed of by an Engagement of the Publique Faith, to ſuch Ends, and Purpoſes, as the Repreſentative of the Nation ſhall deem expedient for the Good of it.</hi> In like manner may all other Intereſts be ſecured; whether of <hi>Opinion,</hi> or <hi>Property,</hi> under what Form of Government ſoever a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> ſhall think fit to unite us. That it is not <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> enough is ſaid. We are now to deduce from your Lordſhips Text, that a <hi>Free State</hi> would be as little <hi>effectual</hi> alſo, as to our concernes. You are pleaſed to intimate the <hi>Dangerous Inclination of the People to Monarchy:</hi> and to Balance the <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> the <hi>Right,</hi> and the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Vote</hi> of <hi>the Nation,</hi> with the <hi>Intereſts</hi> of ſome <hi>few</hi> perſons, <hi>that would Rule us</hi> Themſelves, (for that's the Engliſh of the Settlement they propoſe.) By this Argument, a <hi>Republique, excludes the Negative,</hi> and more <hi>conſiderable Intereſt,</hi> in <hi>favour</hi> of a <hi>Small,</hi> and a <hi>Partial</hi> one: and if it be granted, that a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> will never agree upon a <hi>Free State,</hi> it follows neceſſarily, that <hi>that Form will never do</hi> our Buſineſs. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> what Government ſoever is <hi>forced</hi> upon us, muſt certainly <hi>expire</hi> with the <hi>Force</hi> that impoſed it; and the <hi>Voice of the People</hi> (in this caſe) <hi>is the Declaratory Voice of Providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third Difficulty is. <hi>The Army will never endure it.</hi> This is to ſay, <hi>You are to be Govern'd by the Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>Conclude;</hi> The <hi>Fear of a New War,</hi> and <hi>the promiſe of a ſpeedy Compoſure,</hi> are the <hi>laſt</hi> Suggeſtions of <hi>Diſſwaſion</hi> to us. Alas, my Lord, do we not ſee that <hi>Parties</hi> are uniting againſt us, <hi>Abroad,</hi> and we againſt our <hi>ſelves</hi> at <hi>Home?</hi> How <hi>certainly</hi> ſhall we be <hi>Attempted,</hi> and how <hi>eaſily overcome;</hi> without ſuch a <hi>Medium</hi> to <hi>Reconcile</hi> us All, as may <hi>Pleaſe</hi> us All! <hi>but we are promiſed fair.</hi> We beſeech your Lordſhip to conſider the <hi>Promiſers.</hi> Are not <hi>theſe</hi> the People that <hi>vow'd</hi> to make our <hi>Laſt, a Glorious King?</hi> Juſt ſuch a <hi>Glorious Nation</hi> will they make of <hi>us.</hi> Did they not next <hi>Abjure</hi> a <hi>Single Perſon;</hi> and yet after that, <hi>ſet up ANOTHER,</hi> with <hi>Another Oath?</hi> Not to purſue this Subject further: Theſe Men we dare not Truſt, nor any other of that Leaven, we have no thoughts but of Juſtice to all Intereſts; and in order to that Settlement and Good we wiſh the Nation, we ſhall impower our Repreſentatives with the Command of all we are worth, and moſt remarkably evidence our ſelves, My Lord,</p>
